**Galt Project is an international decentralized land and real estate property registry governed by DAO (Decentralized autonomous organization) and self-governance protocol for communities of homeowners built on top of Ethereum blockchain.**

[@galtproject-community](https://github.com/galtproject/galtproject-community) repo contains smart contracts of Communities of Property Owners.

Owners of land plot and real estate ERC721 tokens can unite in Communities for self-governance. The main goal of such a community is to unite owners in a specific territory, enact laws, and raise funds in ETH, DAI or any ERC20 to achieve common goals (physical protection of property, management of common property, construction of common infrastructure, etc.). 

In fact, the Community is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) of Property owners and may be an alternative to the municipal government. Such a system is devoid of the shortcomings of the existing public administration system since it can't be taken over by corrupt officials.

Communities of Property Owners can be as small as an apartment house, or several neighboring houses, or as big as a whole city or region. Imagine a city where all residents (tenants and homeowners) can use their smartphone to raise funds to the budget in ETH or any ERC20, vote on important issues and choose city managers. All operations are performed on smart contracts and therefore cannot be blocked, restricted, or tampered.

:construction: **[@galtproject-community](https://github.com/galtproject/galtproject-community) stage: :tada:Ethereum Mainnet:tada:**

At the moment, **[@galtproject-community](https://github.com/galtproject/galtproject-community)** contracts are deployed on the Ethereum mainnet. Nonetheless
it is still experimental software that has not yet been publicly audited.

You can find Factory for Communities of Property Owners here: 

:bomb: **Security review status: Internal audit**

Unfortunately, we do not currently have sufficient resources for a full external audit of the smart contracts. 

Our team believes that the Galt Project will enable people to transact land and real estate without borders and third parties. As well as creating self-governing communities without corruption and with transparent governance processes. 
You can contribute to this by checking the code and creating an issue or PR, or by making a small donation to the address of the team **0x98064493535B22F6EbDf475341F0A6DaaBb7b538**.

Also you can use our [Galt Project dApp](https://app.galtproject.io/) on mainnet with Private Property Registries functionality to support Galt Project!
